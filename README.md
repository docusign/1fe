# 1fe (One Frontend) 🚀

A micro-frontend platform that allows teams to focus on creating experiences for the front end utilizing shared utilities and governance controls provided by a single platform team. 1fe achieves this by standardizing the development, deployment and execution of frontend experiences.

Visit our [documentation site](https://1fe.com/start-here/) for comprehensive guides and API references.
