## 0.1.4

### Patch Changes

- 07d9186: Replace non-working BundlePhobia badges with working bundlejs.com alternatives

  Updated bundle size badges across all package README files to use bundlejs.com instead of the non-functional bundlephobia.com service. The new badges provide better functionality and are actively maintained:
  - Changed badge URLs from `bundlephobia.com/result?p=package` to `bundlejs.com/?q=package`
  - Updated badge image URLs from `img.shields.io/bundlephobia/minzip/package` to `deno.bundlejs.com/?q=package&badge=detailed`
  - All npm package badges remain functional and working correctly

  This ensures users can access working bundle analysis tools and view accurate bundle size information.

  - Add license, author, homepage, repository fields to all packages
  - Include logo assets in package files for npm display

  This fixes:
  - Missing npm badges on package pages

  - Missing GitHub repository links
  - Logo not appearing on npm package pages
